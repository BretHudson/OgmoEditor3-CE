### Open Source 2D level editor written in Haxe!

## Getting Started
TODO: Flesh this out
This project requires Haxe and Node v10+.

## Build
```
npm i
npm run build
```
This builds the App and puts it in the `bin` directory. You can then start the app by running `npm start`, or by starting electron in the directory.

## Development
After building the app, you can speed up development by using Webpack's dev server. Running `npm run dev` starts electron and a server that will watch for changes in the project. If changes are found, Webpack will rebuild the source and refresh the app. If there are errors, they will show up in the DevTools.

## Packaging
